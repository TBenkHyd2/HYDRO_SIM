# HYDRO_SIM
Simulation of Hydrological &amp; Meteorological Data based on Principal component Analysis and Probabilistic Model 
Hydrosim contains two parts of simulation: 1- Principal component Analysis (PCA) 
2-From the different generation possibilities offered, we have various simulation methods (Markov chains, probabilistic Models, Inverse Transform Sampling), which will subsequently provide several possible combinations and therefore a variety of possible scenarios. In our case we based on stochastic simulation using probabilistic distribution such as:
1-Log Normal distribution
2-GEV distribution
3-Gamma distribution
4-Goodrich fit distributions.
